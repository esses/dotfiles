## .notes
assumes you're using zsh. you are using zsh, aren't you?

## .from-scratch
so you got a new system. go you!

```
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
brew doctor
brew install zsh
```
use zsh as your default shell.

setup our dotfiles:
```
./script/bootstrap
```
